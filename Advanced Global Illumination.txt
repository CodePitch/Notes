Radiant Power or Flux, 
	The fundamental radiometric quantity is radiant power, also called flux.
	Radiant power, often denoted as Φ, is expressed in watts (W) (joules/sec).(page19)

Irradiance,
	Irradiance (E ) is the incident radiant power on a surface, per unit surface
	area. It is expressed in watts/m^2.(page19)
	
Radiant Exitance or Radiosity,
	Radiant exitance (M ), also called radiosity (B ), is the exitant radiant power
	per unit surface area and is also expressed in watts/m^2.(page20)
	
Radiance,
	Radiance is a five-dimensional quantity that varies with position x and
	direction vector Θ, and is expressed as L(x, Θ).(page20)
